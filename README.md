1. Add ESP-32 board module to arduino IDE by following the tutorial https://microcontrollerslab.com/install-esp32-arduino-ide/
2. Then in the Arduino IDE, navigate to Tools > Board > ESP32 Arduino > select board
  - When dowloading the camera code select AI Thinker ESP32-CAM 
  - When downloading the sensor code select ESP32 Wrover Module
    - When dowloading the sensor code, when the serial monitor says trying to         connect, you need to hold the Io0 button for 3 seconds and release
3. Then download the two zip files for the libraries used: 
4. Then in the Arduino IDE, navigate to Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library. At the top of the drop down list, select the option to "Add .ZIP Library''. (Tutorial: https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/installing-libraries)
5. Then copy paste the code for each microcontroller and upload the code (Use tips in #2)
